# the-knowledge

## Purpose
The developer will attempt to create a tool to automatically parse an information source and produce a set of flash cards to quiz the ~~developer~~ user on the material.

## Approach
1. Provide an information source
2. Parse the source
3. Analyze the source
4. Produce a question and answer set

## How
TBD, but that is the fun part.

Seriously though this project is an investigation into what I can be achieved with natural language processing.

## Project Name Background
__The Knowledge:__ The London taxicab driver is required to be able to decide routes immediately in response to a passenger's request or traffic conditions, rather than stopping to look at a map, relying on satellite navigation or asking a controller by radio. Consequently, the "Knowledge of London" is the in-depth study of a number of pre-set London street routes and all places of interest that taxicab drivers in that city must complete to obtain a licence to operate a black cab.
